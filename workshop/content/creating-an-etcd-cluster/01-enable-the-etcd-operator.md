In this first set of exercises you will install an `etcd` cluster into your project. You will do this by using an operator for `etcd`.

Before we can get started, we need to check that the `etcd` operator has been enabled and is setup to monitor all namespaces in the cluster. If it hasn't we will enable it from the OperatorHub.
